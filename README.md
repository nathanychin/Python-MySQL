A quick way to connect Python and MySQL and communicate between the two.

database.py holds the configs to this database.
setup.py starts with an empty table and allows the user to populate new tables with attributes.

main.py is a demostration of taking the table made in setup.py and turning it into a CRUD application, going through all the motions.
